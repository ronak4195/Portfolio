Achieved seamless machine interpretation by programming 13 Opcode functionalities, 6 Trap routines, and 2 Memory-mapped registers for effective I/O simulation. Implemented an intuitive source code design by isolating CPU and Memory essentials into separate files, while introducing a structured Makefile, for effortless builds. Gained operational and design insights on Assembly, Compilers, and Computer Execution.",
